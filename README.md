Overview of the Projects:

Project 1: 🌐 Project Title:
Weather Forecast Dashboard Using OpenWeatherMap API and Python

📌 Objective:
To develop a Python script that:

Fetches live weather data from a public API (OpenWeatherMap).

Processes and visualizes the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Presents a clear dashboard showing future weather trends (e.g., temperature over time).

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python

Requests – for API calls

Matplotlib – for basic plotting

Seaborn – for styled visualizations

OpenWeatherMap API – for accessing live weather data

🔗 API Used:
OpenWeatherMap 5-day Forecast API

Endpoint: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast

Data: Forecast for every 3 hours over 5 days

Requires: Free API key

🧩 Features:
Real-time API integration to pull weather data for any city.

Temperature trend visualization over a 5-day period.

Time-series line chart for easy understanding of weather progression.

Clean, readable, and customizable plots.

📈 Output:
A graphical dashboard displaying:

X-axis: Date and Time

Y-axis: Temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit)

Optional: Weather descriptions, icons, humidity, wind speed, etc.

🔍 Potential Extensions:
Add interactive visualizations using Plotly or Dash.

Include other weather parameters (e.g., humidity, wind).

Deploy the dashboard as a web app.
